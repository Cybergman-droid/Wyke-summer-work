    <h1 id="about-title">About me</h1>
    <p id="about-text">
      I'm a passionate Computer Science student with a strong interest in
      software development and problem-solving. My journey in programming began
      with a curiosity about how things work, which has since grown into a love
      for solving problems. When I'm not coding, you can find me biking, cooking
      and spending time with my sibilings. I believe in continuous learning and
      am always excited to take on new challenges in the ever-evolving world of
      technology.

    <h2 id="reason-title">Why I chose this course</h2>
    <p id="reason-text">
      I chose to study Computer Science because I'm fascinated by how technology
      shapes our world. The endless possibilities in software development,
      artificial intelligence, and problem-solving through code excite me. I
      enjoy the logical thinking and creativity involved in programming, and I'm
      eager to develop skills that can create meaningful solutions. The tech
      field's constant evolution means there's always something new to learn,
      which I find both challenging and rewarding.
